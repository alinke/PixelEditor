This app requires a piece of hardware called PIXEL: LED ART and WILL NOT work without this external hardware. PIXEL is an interactive LED display for pixel art.

PIXEL Editor is a modified version of the popular Android pixel editor app, Pixelesque, that is integrated with the PIXEL LED hardware display.

Special thanks for RJ Marsan for making this wonderful pixel edtior app available.
